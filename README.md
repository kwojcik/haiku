Generate a haiku with some punctuation and place a period at the end of each line

The first argument can be used as an argument to grep -E for words

protip: `./haiku | say`

Or when someone leaves their laptop unlocked:
```
git clone https://github.com/kwojcik/haiku /tmp/haiku
cd /tmp/haiku
make trollbomb
```
Then close the terminal window
